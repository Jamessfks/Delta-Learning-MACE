Initial commit: Delta-learning MACE hypothesis test

Complete self-contained package including:
- Data: DFT + XTB-augmented liquid water structures (train/valid)
- Models: 25 trained MACE models (direct + delta, N=50/100/200/500)
- Results: Phase 1-3 analysis, figures, FINAL_REPORT
- Scripts: run_all, phase1-5, xtb_calculator, resume_training

Hypothesis REJECTED for liquid water: Direct MACE outperforms delta-learning.
